Virtu.Ella VA Incubator with DIXII ROSE

GROUP RULES 
 
By joining other kickass VA entrepreneurs in the group, “Virtu.Ella VA Incubator,” you agree to the following rules. 
Failure to abide by these rules will result in you and/or your posts being removed from the group. 
Follow the rules and don’t be obnoxious—nobody wants to get kicked out of the cool kids club.
NO SELLING YOURSELF
Don’t be that guy (or gal!). Look, we’re all hustlers here. We get that you want to take every opportunity to grow your business, 
but don’t hijack this group to do it. 
 
Listen up: this group is for building a community with other like-minded people and supporting each other with helpful VA biz know-how. 
It’s not a place for you to snatch contacts, pitch your latest product/offer/service, post jobs or “opportunities”, 
or remind people of your upcoming live broadcast. 
 
Let’s talk specifics. When you join this group, you’re agreeing to a little pact. 
 
As part of this pact, you agree to...
never try to sell anything - events, products, services, courses, or goods or any kind—including adorable children’s clothing, 
high-quality beauty products, press-on nails, etc… 
(this also includes pretending to ask for “feedback” about your latest product/service when you’re actually (not so subtly) trying to get people to buy your shiz)
never direct people to your (call-it-whatever-you-like) landing/opt-in/content upgrade/squeeze page
never use this page to promote a live event like a FB broadcast or webinar
never join this group just to get access to the email list (build your own damn contacts, son)
never share affiliate links
never promote your social media or online platforms (blog, podcast, Facebook post, etc.) 
unless you are directly responding to a question—none of this B.S. "check out this latest blog/podcast/video" nonsense
never post blog posts (badly) disguised as super-lengthy comments
never try to use the group to boost your social followers by sharing your handles/URLs (AGAIN… find your own damn contacts, sheesh!)
never request people check out your website or other resources “for feedback”

FOCUS ON GIVING	
If you joined this group, then that means that you’re here to connect with other VA entrepreneurs and build relationships with other really 
great business-minded VA peeps. 
Take the time to think about what you can offer based on your experiences or expertise before you think about all the ways you can benefit 
from that of your fellow members. 
SHARE WHAT YOU KNOW… NOT WHAT YOU DON’T
If you have valuable information to share with the class, please pipe up! 
Let others benefit from your knowledge or experience in an area… that’s basically the whole point of the group! 
But on the flip side, please don’t spout off on topics you know nothing about. (Nobody likes that guy!) 
While you might be a genuine expert at real estate, it’s probably best to keep your opinions about the latest makeup trends to yourself. 
JERKS SUCK. BE NICE OR LEAVE.
You’re all grown up now, so use your manners. Share with others in a kind, helpful, polite, and engaged manner. 
That means no mean language, rude comments, and generally taking out your superiority complex on others by making them feel like dirt. 
If you want to brag about your awesomeness, do it on your own page. 
DON’T SHARE VIDEOS OR GO LIVE
It’s my page, so I’m the only one with video privileges! (And that includes going live). 
This may seem harsh, but I have found that (more often than not) those helpful little videos people love to share are pretty much always 
off topic or some form of self-promotion—a big group NO NO. 
DON’T SOLICIT YOUR GROUP MEMBERS
And this includes asking people to email or “PM” you for more deets. Not only is that super shady (and hella creepy), but it’s also super scammy! 
Post it in the group, or don’t post it at all. Oh, and DON’T send people messages when they haven’t asked you to do so. 
Where I come from, we call that spamming & scamming (and it’s certainly going to lead to self-promotion). 
Since those are two of the NEVERS from above, it’ll get ya’ kicked out.

“STUFF-THAT’LL-GET-YA-KICKED-OUT” DISCLAIMER
It seems pretty obvious, but if you break the rules above, I’m gonna have to kick you out of the group. 
Also, here’s some other awful stuff that will get ya booted too. 
Profane, defamatory, offensive or violent language
